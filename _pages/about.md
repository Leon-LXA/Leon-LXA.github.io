I am currently a master student at ETH Zurich, majoring in Robitcs, Systems and Control. Previously, I finished my bachelor study at Harbin Institute of Technology(Shenzhen) advised by Prof. Yunjiang Lou and Prof. Haoyao Chen. Then I was a research assistant at Tsinghua University and finished my bachelor thesis advised by Prof. Xueqian Wang. My current interests focus on Motion Planning, Reinforcement Learning and Model Predictive Control.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
